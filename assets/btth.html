<h1>BATTLE THROUGH THE HEAVENS</h1>
<p>
    Xiao Yan the third son of the Patriach(head) of the Xiao clan, growing up
    was a unique talent, at age 13 he became the youngest Dou Zhe(fight
    practitioner),a feet considered outstanding even for an 18 year old. However
    this status was short lived as he found he could no longer store Dou
    Qi(fight energy) for some mysterous reason. This change in status was
    followed by a change in the way he was addressed by those who once praised
    him and sort to be his friend, it even got to the point where his position
    as the third young master of the clan was being scrutinised by the elders of
    the clan. Try as he may, Xiao Yan could not find the source of his
    affliction. He had fallen far from the once renouned genius of the Xiao clan
    to some useless trash who could not even store Dou Qi. This decline
    continued despite his best efforts, trainig twice as hard and working non
    stop. For three years he suffered, rediculed and laughed at and still the
    worse was yet to come.

    Sometime ago during the great war in the Jiama Kingdom, the then Patriach of
    the Xiao clan Xiao Li saved the life of the head of the Nalan clan Nalan Je.
    To express his gratitude, Nalan Je betrothed his granddaughter Nalan Yaryen
    to Xiao Li's grandson Xiao Yan. Years past and Xiao Li past as well causig
    the decline of the Xiao Clan. Nalan Yaryen not lossing by much to Xiao Yan
    in terms of talent and cultivation got accepted into the Yulan Sect, the
    most powerfull organization in the empire. She quickly stood out amongst her
    peers and cought the attention of the sect master Yun yun. Being of great
    talent and from one of the three major families in the empire, she was
    chosen to be the understudy of the sect master to become the next sect
    master. However the sect had strict rules, one of which was that the sect
    master was to have no relations of anykind with the opposite sex.

    After much training and preperation, the day came for the ceremony where
    Nalan Yaryen would be coronated as the young sect master. As faith would
    have it one of the students at the Yulan Sect was aware of the engagement
    between Xiao Yan and Nalan Yaryen. While the ceremony proceeded to the point
    where those who objected to the investature where to speak -a formality to
    show trasparency- a student stood up and brought up the engagement.
    Embarrased, Nalan Yaryen publicly rejected the engagement. Furiuos Nalan Je
    walked out on the ceremony, Yaryen went to him afterwards to plead with him
    to officially dissolve the engagement but Nalan Je would not give in, he was
    a proud man and could not break his promise to a dead friend. In the heat of
    their debate, Nalan Je slapped Yaryen before he could realise it. This
    caused Yaryen to feel betrayed, she stormed out of the room and we all know
    where she was heading next
